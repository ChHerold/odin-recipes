# odin-recipes
Project is to create an html based website for a collection of recipes.
Project goal is to demonstrate the ability to create lists with images in html across several pages and link them together on a homepage.
Secondary goal is to practice commiting projects to git in the proper way.
I anticipate the portion I will struggle with the most is my git commits.
