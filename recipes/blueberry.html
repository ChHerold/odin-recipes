        <p>This is a simple blueberry pie recipe that will surely delight and enchant your guests with its delicious taste and charming appearance. The recipe is simple, requiring only a handful of ingredients so that even a novice pie maker can exceed expectations. If you don't have access to a homemade pie crust then storebought will do fine, but make sure you have two portions. We'll need a spare for the lattice topping.</p>
