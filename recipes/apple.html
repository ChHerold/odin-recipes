        <p1 class="fluff">This apple pie is a surefire fall treat. The combination of two types of apples means we get the best of both worlds, a crisp texture and a sweet taste. It may seem like we're using a lot of apples, but it's important to start off with a lot because they shrink down during the parcooking stage, a necessary step to ensure they keep their shape.</p1>
